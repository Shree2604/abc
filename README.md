## 🔧 Requirements

- The interface of the app was designed with [Taipy GUI](https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy)
- The neural network used in the app was designed with [PyTorch](https://github.com/Shree2604/10-Monkey-Classification-ML-Project/blob/main/10%20MONKEY%20PROJECT.ipynb)
- The user provided images were loaded with [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow)
- And [Numpy](https://github.com/numpy/numpy) was used to normalize those images


# 🛠️ Setup

Follow these steps to get the Machine Learning GUI App up and running on your local machine:

1. **Download the Repository**: Clone or download this repository into your local machine. You can use the following command to clone the repository if you have git installed:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link
    ```
2. **Create a Virtual Environment (venv)**: It's recommended to create a virtual environment to keep the dependencies required by this project separate from your other projects. Here's how you can create a venv:
    ```
    python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
    ```
    And activate it with this command:
    ```
    source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
    ```
3. **Install the Requirements**: Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository and install the required packages using pip:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. **Use the Pre-existing Model**: The machine learning model used for image classification is already available in the repository. You don't need to create a new one.

5. **Run the Application**: Now, you're all set to run the application. Use the following command to start the app:
    ```
    python classifier.py
    ```
6. **Enjoy!** 🎉🎉🎉: Start classifying images with your new Machine Learning GUI App! Enjoy the process and learn more about machine learning and GUI applications.

Remember, this is a simple app designed for beginners. Don't hesitate to customize it and add more features as you learn more about machine learning and GUI development. Happy coding! 🚀
